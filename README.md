== Description ==

This plugin helps you to comply with the 2009/136/CE Directive, whose requirements require you to not install cookies in users' browser untill they permit so, explicitly or implicitly.

It gives your visitors the option to opt in (or leave the webpage) any third party applications such as Google Analytics or Ad Sense. The plugin then leaves a cookie of its own to remember them next time. The cookie will expire after one year.

== Installation ==

To install the plugin manually:

1. Extract the contents of the archive (zip file)
2. Upload the folder and its contents to your ‘/wp-content/plugins’ folder
3. Activate the plugin through the Plugins section in your WordPress admin panel
4. You should see a new "CookiesControl" item under "Options" menu where you can config some settings. 

Usage

Check the new "CookiesControl" item under "Options" menu, where an info screen will provide you further details. Check also the Widgets screen: a new "CookiesControl" widget should be available. The code in CookiesControl widgets will be executed only after the user has accepted the cookies.
