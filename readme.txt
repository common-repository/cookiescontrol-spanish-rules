Get in line with the law and add an 'Accept Cookies' notice to your website

== Description ==

This plugin helps you to comply with the 2009/136/CE Directive, whose requirements require you to not install cookies in users' browser untill they permit so, explicitly or implicitly.

It gives your visitors the option to opt in (or leave the webpage) any third party applications such as Google Analytics or Ad Sense (check the options page and also the widget area in the dashboard). The plugin then leaves a cookie of its own to remember the user's choice until the user close its browser. 

It's based in Christian Senior's Choc Chip EU Cookie WordPress Plugin 1.0. Check the changelog to see what has been added.
